Today, I sent an email to Nancy Fulda asking to join her research team.  Dr. Fulda specializes in NLP, and I'm hoping she will provide me the flexibility to bring my own ideas into the lab.

Some new project ideas from today: "reach out and be mentored" program where you can build connections by reaching out to people, like a engineers, students, etc, just to chat and learn more about each other. Another: a layman's automatic lawyer, that crowdsources lots of contracts in order to automatically determine if a contract is "normal" in order to tell you when there's an anomaly.  Perhaps when there's an anomaly, there would be an "explain" button that shows what's different and maybe even outsources to a remote paralegal who takes a look.

I investigated Optical Music Recognition today since I was thinking about making a better sightreading app.  But unfortunately, the technology is still hit and miss, and I also found a better way - just download full sightreading books off of IMSLP and read through them.  That's the implicit competitor in this space that Todd was talking about.  For now, I'm going to shelf the idea. I think the only compelling feature of that app would be that I could produce curated datasets for sightreading by topic, like hymns, classical, jazz, choir music, accompaniments for violin, etc.  Maybe someday.

I also spent a good chunk of time today doing GRE questions - some of them are very tricky, especially in the verbal section.  I'd like to spend at least some time everyday working on practice questions and I hope to be comfortable enough to take the GRE with confidence by August.
