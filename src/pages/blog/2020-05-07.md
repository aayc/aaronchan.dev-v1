Today I was again thinking deeply about the future and interviewing some amazing people!  Some of the advice I received:

- When an undergraduate, be less picky about research projects.  Focus more on exploring - if the project doesn't seem interesting then it could be because you don't believe it's interesting.
  
- Research requires focus and work - being stretched too thin is a real thing and will damage you.
  
- Maybe graduate school isn't necessary.  Not interested in doing research?  Why would you do graduate school?
  
- Joining someone else's project and riding it to completion is a fine strategy.
