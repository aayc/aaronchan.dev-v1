Oops, I missed a day!  Yesterday I spent all day working on the MLH Hacklarious Hackathon on Hacker Studio, a next-generation Hackertyper that pulls in data from Github API (using MongoDB as a cache layer and Gatsby + Netlify for the frontend) that allows you to code "super fast" by replaying the repository contents on the fly.  My friend and I worked on the project.

We used Monaco editor for syntax highlighter and editor capability.  Now that I think on it, we probably could have used just a textarea with prismjs for higher performance.

Out of 200+ teams, we won Best Use of MongoDB Atlas!  Hooray!  We spent just over 10 hours hacking on this thing and it was a lot of fun.  See our [post](https://devpost.com/software/hacker-studio-ui7ox5).
