Blogs really help me see my own indecisiveness.  Today I decided that I'm not going to focus on research after all.  I thought about it, and I think that I enjoy building things and being an engineer more than I enjoy being a research scientist.

That doesn't mean that I'm set in stone - I might change my decision again.  But for today, I feel really good about pursuing the engineering path.

I'm not sure if swaying in one's decisions is a weakness or just a symptom of having an open mind?  I guess I will know when I look back.  What I believe right now is that I need to make a decision, because focus is powerful and being spread too thin will make me use my time less efficiently.
