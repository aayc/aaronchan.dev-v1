I woke up on Sunday and found out that the scholarship that I had wanted since before I ever entered college had been given to two other students.

Stomach bottoming out? **Check.**

Hearing the echo of disappointed parental sighing? **Check.**

That familiar ache of inadequacy? **Check.**

Rationalizing came as easy as breathing: maybe there was a form I had forgotten to fill out, maybe the committee had just forgotten my name or maybe it was political!

Nope, sorry Aaron.  These students were a better pick than you.  They were not only more talented, but had worked harder.  They deserved it more than you.

Then, I felt all of the reaffirmations of self-doubt that hardened into a cold weight embedded in my chest.  Yeah, these are the people that get top tier jobs.  These are the people who get into top tier graduate schools.  Not me.  I'll be rejected from those jobs, those schools, those customers.  I'm outclassed by people who know exactly what they're doing while I fumble around laughing at memes on Reddit in my spare time.

God knows I've been in this situation so many times before today.

The most important thing I've learned is that times like these are reminders of focus.  They force me to observe the gap between me and the kind of person I want to be.  And they also cause me to re-evaluate if that is who I wanted to be in the first place.  Would I trade my ability to speak Chinese for the number of research publications that would have made the judges choose me?  Would I trade my ability to improvise on the piano for that company's name on my resume?

Sometimes the answer is yes.  I would have traded the hours I've spent looking at the latest smartphones for a research paper.  I wish I could have.  But nothing teaches me that better than a good ole slap in the face.

Sometimes the answer is no.  If I had that company's name on my resume, I honestly would have wanted to trade it for the ability to speak Chinese.  So it's okay.  It's all too easy to confuse my definition of "amazing" with what everyone thinks is amazing.

Moments like these really hurt, especially when it's a one-time dream, and if I use them right, they'll make me into a stronger, more mature person.
