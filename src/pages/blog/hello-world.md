Hello world!

My name is Aaron Chan.  I'm an undergraduate student at BYU, studying Computer Science and Applied Statistics, former intern at GE Global Research, Lexikeet, Microsoft, and Facebook.  I'm a pianist, cellist, percussionist, conversationally fluent in English, Spanish, and Chinese, and my professional expertise is in machine learning and distributed systems.  But for the most part, I'm kind of a joke-around kind of guy and I love to talk about both the little and big things in life.  I usually keep to myself, I don't like parties, and I get really tired by the end of the day.

I've decided to be more open with my life and write a daily blog for at least 100 days.  Maybe it'll go nowhere, but maybe it'll be useful - if not to anyone else, than at least to future me.
