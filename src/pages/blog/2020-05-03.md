A while ago, I watched some videos of the comedian Mike Birbiglia.  He's pretty funny.  I checked out his website and found his blog, entitled "My Secret Public Journal."  For some reason, that's always stuck with me.

I was reading a Medium post today by my old boss/mentor at WhatsApp, about [why he started writing more](https://medium.com/@chrisjluc/why-i-started-writing-more-at-home-and-at-work-8a015981d6f7). To be honest, I've always wanted to start a blog but every time I start writing, I don't feel like posting.  What do I have to write about that would be valuable to the world, anyway?

But after realizing that I was reading some guy's blog post just about his life, I decided that maybe I should get in the habit of sharing.

Writing and sharing things makes me confront who I really am.  It's weird thinking that someday my mom, my boss, and my girlfriend might all be reading this (if that happened would it mean something in my life either went horribly wrong or incredibly right?).  Face to face, I can't help but give each of them different perspectives on the same personal experience.  Here, I have to.

I'm really excited to learn all the things that blogging has to teach me!
